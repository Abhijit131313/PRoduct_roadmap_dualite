/*
          # [DEFINITIVE FIX] Reset and Recreate Organization Management Security
          This migration completely resets and correctly re-implements the functions and Row Level Security (RLS) policies for creating and managing organizations. It is designed to be a final, comprehensive fix for the persistent "cannot create organization" and "function does not exist" errors.

          ## Query Description: [This script will drop all existing (and potentially broken) policies and functions related to organization management and recreate them from scratch in the correct order and with the correct permissions. This includes using a `SECURITY DEFINER` function for organization creation, which is the standard and secure way to handle this operation. This should resolve all related bugs and security warnings.]
          
          ## Metadata:
          - Schema-Category: ["Structural", "Security"]
          - Impact-Level: ["High"]
          - Requires-Backup: false
          - Reversible: false
          
          ## Structure Details:
          - Drops and recreates functions: `is_org_member`, `create_organization_and_assign_admin`, `invite_organization_member`, `accept_invitation`, `decline_invitation`, `update_organization_member_role`, `remove_organization_member`.
          - Drops and recreates all RLS policies on `organizations`, `organization_members`, `projects`, `roadmaps`, `initiatives`, `features`, `releases`, and `invitations`.
          
          ## Security Implications:
          - RLS Status: [Enabled]
          - Policy Changes: [Yes]
          - Auth Requirements: [All operations are protected by RLS and require authentication.]
          - Fixes `Function Search Path Mutable` warnings by setting a secure search path on all functions.
          
          ## Performance Impact:
          - Indexes: [None]
          - Triggers: [None]
          - Estimated Impact: [Low. Re-establishes security rules, no impact on query performance.]
